; FIXME: (test:closure_capture_return_closure) Do not copy-paste the output LLVM IR here, the test itself is passing LLVM IR verification, but the actual LLVM IR is incorrect! A function is being called without the captures environment (aka. missing a parameter). This is due to the current flawed design of the closure capture's construct (where the environment is allocated at the call site).
