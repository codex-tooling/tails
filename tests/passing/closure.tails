func tests() -> unit:
  -- BUG: This appears in-scope for closures: let hello_from_the_other_side = 124. Perhaps name resolution must be handled differently for closures: closures' scope should be created in an 'isolated' scope, with nothing on top of it (ie. no parent scope), except for the global scope.

  let a = |n: int|
    n * 2

  let b = || 0

  discard a(0)

  let c = (|| 1222)()

  discard a(b())
